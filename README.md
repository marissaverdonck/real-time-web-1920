## Concept

### The assignment

Build a meaningful real-time application. Learn techniques to setup an open connection between the client and the server. This will enable you to send data in real-time both ways, at the same time.

### Help people in Corona time with their groceries

Users can share their address and post a shopping list on a map. The helpers/deliverers can accept the shopping list. Now a live connection is threatened between the two users. The recipient can see where the delivery person is while the deliverer gets a live route via the Here API.



Bob-a job is when children doing small jobs for a bob ('bob' is the old name for a shilling, now 5 pence). The idea for the concept originated in the era of corona. I was thinking of older people who can't get out of their house because of the risk of infection. While other people are bored or have no job anymore. Maybe these people can help each other through the app. 

Users can share their address and post a job-list on a map. The helpers/deliverers can accept the list. Now a live chat connection is threatened between the two users.
