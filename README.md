# Real-Time Web @cmda-minor-web Â· 2019-2020

## Concept
Help people in Corona time with their groceries.

Users can share their address and post a shopping list on a map. The helpers/deliverers can accept the shopping list. Now a live connection is threatened between the two users. The recipient can see where the delivery person is while the deliverer gets a live route via the Here API.

## Data Life Cycle
